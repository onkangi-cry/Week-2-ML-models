"AI for Climate Resilience: Forecasting Air Pollution Levels with Supervised Learning"
 1. SDG & Specific Problem
SDG 13: Climate Action
Problem: Rapid urbanization and industrialization are worsening air pollution, especially in developing countries. Poor air quality leads to climate effects and severe health problems.
Goal: Predict PM2.5 pollution levels using weather and environmental data to enable early warnings and inform climate policies.

 2. ML Approach
Supervised Learning: Regression
Model learns from labeled data (input: weather conditions; output: PM2.5 levels).

Algorithms you can use:

Linear Regression (baseline)

Random Forest Regressor (robust and interpretable)

Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost for high accuracy)

. Ethical Reflection
 Fairness & Bias:
Urban data may not represent rural areas → include diverse regions in training.

Sensor quality varies → validate data sources.

Ensure accessibility for communities at risk (e.g., via mobile alerts).

Sustainability:
Early warning enables smarter transportation, school closures, or public health actions.

Can help governments set pollution caps or transition to clean energy.
